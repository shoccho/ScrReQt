# üöß ( Under development ‚öíÔ∏è ) A simple screen recorder that utilizes ffmpeg to screen record üöß

### It is a PyQt5 app that runs ffmpeg to capture the screen and save it to a file


### How to run

### currently only works on windows

#### The hard way ( or maybe the easy way considering all the virus warning from binary builds )
- Install python3
- download this repo and run the `ffmpeg_installer.bat` (it'll download and install ffmpeg)
- install the python dependencies via pip `pip install -r requirements. txt`
- run the `Screc.py` via python `python3 Screc.py`

#### The easy way ( coming soon... )
- Download Binary build for your os
- run the setup script (to install ffmpeg)
- run the binary 


# current features
- capture full screen
- capture an area of the screen
